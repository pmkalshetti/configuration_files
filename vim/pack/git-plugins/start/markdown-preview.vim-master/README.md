```

### Usage

```
> when MarkdownPreview command can't open preview window, you can use the
MarkdownPreviewStop command before using MarkdownPreview command

**Default Setting:**

```
    let g:mkdp_path_to_chrome = ""
    " path to the chrome or the command to open chrome(or other modern browsers)
    " if set, g:mkdp_browserfunc would be ignored

    let g:mkdp_browserfunc = 'MKDP_browserfunc_default'
    " callback vim function to open browser, the only param is the url to open

    let g:mkdp_auto_start = 0
    " set to 1, the vim will open the preview window once enter the markdown
    " buffer

    let g:mkdp_auto_open = 0
    " set to 1, the vim will auto open preview window when you edit the
    " markdown file

    let g:mkdp_auto_close = 1
    " set to 1, the vim will auto close current preview window when change
    " from markdown buffer to another buffer

    let g:mkdp_refresh_slow = 0
    " set to 1, the vim will just refresh markdown when save the buffer or
    " leave from insert mode, default 0 is auto refresh markdown as you edit or
    " move the cursor

    let g:mkdp_command_for_global = 0
    " set to 1, the MarkdownPreview command can be use for all files,
    " by default it just can be use in markdown file

    let g:mkdp_open_to_the_world = 0
    " set to 1, preview server available to others in your network
    " by default, the server only listens on localhost (127.0.0.1)
```

**Key Mapping:**

By default this Plugin has no mapping, if you want to has your own mapping
you can map the keys to `<Plug>MarkdownPreview` for opening markdown preview window and
map keys to `<Plug>StopMarkdownPreview` for closing the preview window

Examples for mapping the `F8` key to open markdown preview window and `F9` key to
close preview window:

```
nmap <silent> <F8> <Plug>MarkdownPreview        " for normal mode
imap <silent> <F8> <Plug>MarkdownPreview        " for insert mode
nmap <silent> <F9> <Plug>StopMarkdownPreview    " for normal mode
imap <silent> <F9> <Plug>StopMarkdownPreview    " for insert mode
```

For **OS X** users you can set the `g:mkdp_path_to_chrome` as below (if you use chrome):

```
let g:mkdp_path_to_chrome = "open -a Google\\ Chrome"
" or
let g:mkdp_path_to_chrome = "/Applications/Google\\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\\ Chrome"
```
